    <h1>What is a weather forecast for?</h1>
    <p>Every person needs to know the weather forecast, and not only for one day, but most often for several days ahead.
        This allows you to understand how to dress yourself, dress your children according to the weather,
        as well as to beware of the appearance of any health complications associated with changes in atmospheric pressure, air temperature.
        We need a forecast to make plans for daily activities,
        which are held on the street, in the fresh air, as well as plan walks,
        weekends, holidays and holidays.
        In a word, the weather has a significant impact on human life, ranging from issues,
        in what clothes to go to work, whether to take an umbrella, whether to cover the zucchini with a film at night in the vegetable garden,
        to issues of launching rockets, building houses and so on.</p>
